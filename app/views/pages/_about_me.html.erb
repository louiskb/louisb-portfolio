        <p class="text-about fs-6">Mixed British-Thai developer based in Thailand, which I now call home after growing up across multiple countries. Fluent in English and Thai, with a long-standing love of tech 🤓 that naturally led into full‑stack development. Also an independent trader and financial analyst, combining technical charting with a structured, risk‑first approach to the markets 📊. <br>
          <br>
          Beyond code and charts, staying active is a big part of life—lifting, kitesurfing, running, and hiking—and that love of adventure took me all the way through New Zealand’s 3,000 km Te Araroa thru‑hike, which I completed over four months in 2024/2025 🚀.</p>
